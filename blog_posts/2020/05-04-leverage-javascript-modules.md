It's always a good idea to split your application into modules with a bounded responsibility.

For example if your application dealt with culture, you might have a film module:

```js
// film.js

export function create() {}

export function isValid() {}
```

In Javascript world, we usually import those functions by name:

```js
// elsewhere.js

import { create } from "./film";

let newFilm = create({ title: "Sonatine" });
```

Now this code is really prone to name collision. If we were to import the `create` function for a book, we would need to use aliases:

```js
import { create as createFilm } from "./film";
import { create as createBook } from "./book";
```

It doesn't look that bad with a handful of imports. But in real world it gets messy real quick.

When working with languages like ReasonML or Elixir, there is no import statement. Anywhere in your code, you can call a function from another module. You do that by referencing the module name directly in your code. It would look like this in ReasonML:

```reason
// Film.re

let create = () => {}

// Elsewhere.re

let newFilm = Film.create({ title: "Sonatine"})
```

Note that there is no export statement either, a module is automatically defined for the file. The JavaScript equivalent would use the "wildcard import":

```js
import * as Film from "./film";

const newFilm = Film.create({ title: "Sonatine" });
```

Aside from giving you incentives to modularize your application, that way of importing things will make your code more explicit and your life easier when it comes to naming things.

Did you ever find yourself frustrated by how `isValid` could be a function as well as a boolean ?

Well, this issue can be solved without even thinking about it:

```js
// Before

import { isValid as getIsValidBook } from "./book";

const isValidBook = getIsValidBook(myBook);

// After

import * as Books from "./book";

const isValidBook = Book.isValid(myBook);
```
